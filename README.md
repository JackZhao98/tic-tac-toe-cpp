## C++ Tic Tac Toe (in one single file)

#### Write in the front
  This is an introductory CS class project of Tic Tac Toe, one single file, no headers, no classes, etc.

#### Params Explanation


```c++
const int X = -1;   //  Define the code for player X is -1
const int O = 1;    //  Define the code for player O is 1
```
